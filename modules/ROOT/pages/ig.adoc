== Prerequisites

Before installing your dog, make sure you have the following:
* A _dog-friendly_ environment
* A **lot** of patience
* Food and water bowls
* A soft bed
* Dog toys
* Leash and collar

== Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Prepare the environment:**
Make sure your home is safe for a new dog by removing hazards like sharp objects or toxic plants. Set up a cozy area with a bed and some toys to make the space welcoming.

2. **Download Dog:**
Acquire your dog from a reputable source (shelter, breeder, or rescue group). Make sure the "installation package" is complete with all medical checks and vaccinations.

3. **Initial Setup:**
Introduce the dog to your home slowly. Show them the feeding area, sleeping spot, and where they can find water. Let them explore at their own pace.

4. **Install Essentials:**
a. Set up the leash and collar.
b. Begin with a simple command training like "sit" or "stay."
c. Gradually start introducing a routine (walks, feeding times).

5. **Ongoing Maintenance:**
Your dog will require regular care and maintenance:
* Daily feeding and water refills
* Regular walks and exercise
* Vet visits for updates on "software" (vaccines and health checks)

6. **Upgrade Options:**
* Teach new tricks like fetch or roll over.
* Customize with accessories (collars, clothing, etc.).

== Troubleshooting

If your dog is barking excessively, it may require more exercise or mental stimulation. Provide chew toys or engage in interactive play.

== Uninstallation

* This option is not recommended! Once installed, dogs offer unconditional love and companionship.
